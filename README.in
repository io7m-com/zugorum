## zugorum

The `zugorum` package provides a server for making requests to external sites
in order to test liveness, and publishing the results as [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
metrics.

## Features

* Check the liveness of external sites and publish Prometheus metrics.
* A small, easily auditable codebase.
* Platform independence. No platform-dependent code is included in any form,
  and installations can largely be carried between platforms without changes.
* [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/)-ready: Ready to run as an immutable,
  stateless, read-only, unprivileged container for maximum security and
  reliability.
* [OSGi](https://www.osgi.org/)-ready.
* [JPMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System)-ready.
* ISC license.

## Usage

```
{
  "ListenAddress": "0.0.0.0",
  "ListenPort": 8190,
  "Checks": [
    {
      "Type": "HTTP2xx",
      "URI": "https://example.invalid",
      "PauseMinimum": "PT1S",
      "PauseMaximum": "PT10S"
    },
    {
      "Type": "HTTP2xx",
      "URI": "https://www.io7m.com",
      "PauseMinimum": "PT1S",
      "PauseMaximum": "PT10S"
    },
    {
      "Type": "HTTP2xx",
      "URI": "http://www.io7m.com",
      "PauseMinimum": "PT1S",
      "PauseMaximum": "PT10S"
    },
    ...

```

```
$ zugorum server --configuration config.json
```

Prometheus metrics will be available on port `8190`.
